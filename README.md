## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework (for styles)

### What I learned

- Learned how to use tailwind classes for designing.
- Learned how to create custom classes to use in tailwind.
- How to create responsive designs using tailwind. how it helps reducing css for building complex layouts.

### Continued development

- Completing the whole design with background shapes because i couldn't figure out how to build those shapes with tailwind in responsive manner.

### Useful resources

- [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) - Docs for using tailwind classes.
- [Styling the background shape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YYMt1T_NzQ) - I tried creating the background shapes taking this video as reference but since it has its own implementation of structuring the page itself i can't figure it out. it may help others.
